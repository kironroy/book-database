This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Prompts

## Kiron:
Please help me create a react web page that has a database of books that I own. I will host this website on Netlify, I want routing and I want to use google's firebase as my database.


## CoPilot:
To assist you effectively, could you clarify a few details about your project?

Book Database Features: What specific information about your books do you want to store (e.g., title, author, genre, publication year)? Should users be able to add, edit, or delete entries?

Routing Requirements: What pages do you envision for your website? For example, a homepage, a book list page, a book details page, etc.?

Firebase Integration: Do you already have a Firebase project set up, or would you like guidance on creating one?

Styling Preferences: Do you have a design or theme in mind for the website, or should I suggest a basic layout?

## Kiron: 
I kept the style of the app basic for now.

# Page Details 

## **BookForm.js**
The `BookForm.js` file is a **React component** designed to handle both adding and editing books in your app. It provides a **form UI** where users can enter book details‚Äî**title, author, subject, and format**‚Äîand submit them.

### **Why Is It in the Components Folder?**
It is stored in the `components/` folder because:
1. **Reusability** ‚Äì This form is used in multiple pages (e.g., adding a book in `BookList.js`, editing a book in `BookDetails.js`).
2. **Separation of Concerns** ‚Äì It keeps UI components separate from page logic.
3. **Modular Design** ‚Äì React apps benefit from breaking features into smaller, reusable components.

### **How Does It Work?**
- The form **uses React state (`useState`)** to store user input.
- When submitted (`handleSubmit`), it **passes the book data** to a parent component via the `onSubmit` prop.
- The **Cancel button** (`onCancel` prop) allows discarding changes when editing.
- **Bootstrap classes** (`form-control`, `btn`, `container`, etc.) improve styling.

### **Where Is It Used?**
- `BookList.js` ‚Üí for adding a book.
- `BookDetails.js` ‚Üí for editing a book.

This ensures your app has a clean, reusable design. 

<hr>

## **BookDetails.js**
The `BookDetails.js` file is a **React page component** responsible for **displaying, editing, and deleting** individual books from the Firestore database. When a user clicks on a book in the list, this page retrieves and shows the book's details.

### **Why Is It in the Pages Folder?**
It‚Äôs placed inside `pages/` because it represents a **full page** rather than just a reusable UI element. Components in `pages/` are directly linked to routes (e.g., `/books/:bookId`) and structure the layout of distinct sections in your app.

### **How It Works:**
- **Fetches book data** from Firebase Firestore using `useEffect` and `getDoc()`.
- **Displays book details** (title, author, subject, format).
- **Allows editing** using `BookForm`, which updates the book in Firestore (`updateDoc()`).
- **Handles deletion** using `deleteDoc()` and redirects users back to the book list.
- **Uses Bootstrap styling** (`container`, `btn-warning`, `border`, etc.).
- **Manages page state** (`useState` for `isEditing` and `book`).

### **When Is It Used?**
- When a user clicks **"View Details"** in `BookList.js`, they are navigated to `/books/:bookId`, which loads this page.
- Allows users to **modify or remove** book entries.

This file ensures each book can be managed in a dedicated, structured way.

<hr>

## **BookList.js**
The `BookList.js` file is responsible for **displaying a list of books**, **adding new books**, and **deleting books** from the Firestore database. It retrieves book data using Firebase and dynamically updates the list when books are added or removed.

### **Why Is It in the Pages Folder?**
This file belongs in `pages/` because:
- It represents a **full page** in the app rather than just a reusable UI element.
- It is tied to a **specific route** (`/books`), meaning it functions as a standalone screen.
- It combines logic for **fetching, adding, and deleting books**, making it different from smaller components like `BookForm.js`, which only handles form inputs.

### **How It Works:**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Fetches book data from Firestore** using `useEffect()` and `getDocs()` when the page loads.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Displays a list of books** with Bootstrap styling (`list-group`, `btn-sm`, etc.).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Allows users to add books** using `BookForm`, which sends new entries to Firestore (`addDoc()`).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Handles book deletion** (`deleteDoc()`) and updates the state to remove deleted entries.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Navigates to the Book Details page** when clicking **View Details** (`useNavigate()`).  

### **Where Is It Used?**
- This page is accessed from the **main book list** at `/books`.
- When a user clicks on "Books" in the navigation menu, they land on this page.
- From here, they can **view details** or **delete books**.

 **It‚Äôs the core book management page.**

 <hr>

 ## **Home.js**
The `Home.js` file serves as the **landing page** of your book database application. When users visit the root URL (`/`), they are greeted with a welcoming message explaining the purpose of the app. 

### **Why Is It in the Pages Folder?**
This file is placed in `pages/` because it represents a **full-page view** rather than just a reusable UI component. Pages typically correspond to **routes** in the app, meaning they define distinct sections that users navigate between. In this case:
- `Home.js` is loaded when the user visits `/`.
- It introduces users to the app with a **title and description**.
- It applies **Bootstrap styling** (`container`, `text-primary`, `text-muted`, etc.) for a clean look.

<hr>

## **App.js**
`App.js` is the **main entry point** for your React app, responsible for managing routes and the overall structure of your pages. It defines the **navigation bar** and connects pages like **Home**, **BookList**, and **BookDetails** through `Routes`.

### **Why Is It in the Root Folder?**
- `App.js` acts as the **central hub** for rendering all pages.
- It's usually placed at the root (`src/`) because React applications need a **single source of truth** for routing and layout.
- It serves as the **top-level component**, wrapping the entire app.

### **Does It Have to Be in the Route?**
Yes, `App.js` typically needs to be within the **main routing structure** to manage navigation correctly. However, if you removed it from routing:
1. **Moving Routing to `index.js`**
   ```jsx
   import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
   import App from "./App";

   ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
     <BrowserRouter>
       <App />
     </BrowserRouter>
   );
   ```
   - Here, routing is handled in `index.js`, and `App.js` **doesn't need `<Routes>`**.

2. **Without Routing, App.js Would Lose Navigation**
   - If `App.js` **didn't include `<Routes>`**, you'd have to manage page changes manually.
   - Without React Router, navigating between pages would require **full-page reloads**, instead of smooth client-side transitions.

### **What If It Wasn‚Äôt in the Root?**
If `App.js` was moved inside `pages/`:
- It would be treated as just another **individual page**, breaking its role as the main structure.
- Other components would need an additional wrapper for layout.
- A new parent component would need to handle **global navigation**.

### **Summary**
‚úÖ `App.js` is best kept at the **root** of `src/` to manage the full application layout.  
‚úÖ It **must include routing** (`Routes`) to allow navigation.  
‚úÖ **If removed from the route**, navigation would require manual updates.
